# Refactoring Tab Improvements TODO

## High Priority
1. Fix Code Comparison View
   - [x] Fix the `file_content` undefined error
   - [x] Ensure proper synchronization between original and refactored code views
   - [ ] Add line-by-line diff highlighting
   - [ ] Add collapsible sections for better navigation

2. Improve Model Selection
   - [ ] Add model status indicators (loading, ready, error)
   - [ ] Add model loading progress bar
   - [ ] Improve error handling for model loading failures
   - [ ] Add model configuration options (temperature, max tokens)

3. Enhance Refactoring Options
   - [ ] Add custom refactoring patterns selection
   - [ ] Implement refactoring preview before applying
   - [ ] Add undo/redo functionality for refactoring changes
   - [ ] Add option to save refactoring history

## Medium Priority
4. Code Analysis Improvements
   - [ ] Add real-time syntax checking
   - [ ] Integrate with code quality metrics
   - [ ] Add code complexity visualization
   - [ ] Show potential impact of refactoring

5. User Interface Enhancements
   - [ ] Add dark/light mode toggle
   - [ ] Improve code editor with syntax highlighting
   - [ ] Add minimap for code navigation
   - [ ] Add search and replace functionality

6. Refactoring History
   - [ ] Add version control integration
   - [ ] Track refactoring changes
   - [ ] Allow comparing different versions
   - [ ] Export refactoring history

## Low Priority
7. Documentation
   - [ ] Add tooltips for each refactoring option
   - [ ] Add examples for each refactoring pattern
   - [ ] Add best practices guidelines
   - [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts

8. Performance Optimization
   - [ ] Optimize code diff calculation
   - [ ] Add caching for refactored code
   - [ ] Improve loading times
   - [ ] Add batch refactoring option

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Refactor the `render_refactoring_tab` function into smaller components
- [ ] Improve error handling and logging
- [ ] Add unit tests for refactoring logic
- [ ] Clean up unused code and imports

## Notes
- Focus on fixing the code comparison view first
- Ensure all changes are backward compatible
- Test with different file sizes and code complexities
- Consider adding automated testing for refactoring patterns

## Dependencies
- Need to update `gptlab_integration.py` for better model handling
- May need to modify `smell_detection.py` for improved analysis
- Consider adding new utility functions for code comparison

## Timeline
1. Morning: Fix high-priority issues (code comparison, model selection)
2. Afternoon: Work on medium-priority improvements
3. Evening: Documentation and testing

Remember to:
- Make frequent commits
- Test changes incrementally
- Update documentation as you go
- Keep the user informed of progress through the UI
