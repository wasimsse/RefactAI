### TODO List

1. **Pre-Refactoring Validation**
   - [ ] Add static validation checks before applying refactoring (e.g., dependency analysis, test coverage).
   - [ ] Add an LLM "sanity check" step before finalizing user-selected refactorings.

2. **Automated Testing & Rollback**
   - [ ] Integrate test running after refactoring; block if tests fail.
   - [ ] Add a rollback/undo feature for applied refactorings.

3. **Logging & Traceability**
   - [ ] Log all refactoring actions, user choices, and LLM responses for traceability.

4. **Advanced Recommendations**
   - [ ] Implement dynamic pattern ranking/highlighting based on severity, frequency, and code metrics.
   - [ ] Add a pattern impact preview (summary of code changes for each pattern).

5. **User Feedback Loop**
   - [ ] Allow users to rate or comment on pattern usefulness/results.

6. **Extensibility**
   - [ ] Add a plugin/config system for new patterns.

### Implementation Mapping Table

| Feature                        | Where to Implement (Suggested Files/Functions)                |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pre-Refactoring Validation     | `dashboard.py` (before LLM call), `pattern_safety.py`         |
| Automated Testing & Rollback   | `dashboard.py` (after refactoring), new test/rollback modules |
| Logging & Traceability         | `dashboard.py`, new logging module                            |
| Advanced Recommendations       | `refactoring_patterns.py`, pattern selection UI               |
| User Feedback Loop             | Pattern selection/preview UI, new feedback module             |
| Extensibility                  | `refactoring_patterns.py`, plugin/config system               |

### Where to Implement (Choose Patterns Step)

The following table summarizes the best place in the UI/codebase to implement each feature, focusing on the 'Choose Patterns' step under the Refactoring tab:

| Feature                        | Best Place in UI/Codebase (for "Choose Patterns" step)         |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pre-Refactoring Validation     | `dashboard.py` (on "Next: Preview Changes" click, after pattern selection) |
| Automated Testing & Rollback   | `dashboard.py` (after refactoring, info/reminder in UI)        |
| Logging & Traceability         | `dashboard.py` (log on pattern selection/confirmation)         |
| Advanced Recommendations       | `refactoring_patterns.py` (ranking), `dashboard.py` (UI logic) |
| User Feedback Loop             | `dashboard.py` (feedback widget in UI)                        |
| Extensibility                  | `refactoring_patterns.py` (backend), `dashboard.py` (UI link)  |

## Refactoring Pattern System: Enhancement Plan (for tomorrow)

- [ ] **Pattern Recommendation Intelligence**
    - [ ] Dynamic Pattern Ranking: Rank and highlight patterns based on severity, frequency, code metrics, and past user choices
    - [ ] Pattern Impact Preview: Show a summary of what each pattern will change in the code
- [ ] **Pattern-Driven LLM Prompting**
    - [ ] Pattern-to-Prompt Mapping: Generate tailored prompt snippets for each selected pattern
    - [ ] Pattern Combination Handling: Combine instructions for multiple patterns intelligently
- [ ] **User Experience & UI**
    - [ ] Pattern Details Modal: Click for before/after code, usage tips, and external links
    - [ ] Pattern Search & Filter: Quickly find patterns by name, category, or effect
- [ ] **Feedback Loop**
    - [ ] User Feedback on Patterns: Let users rate usefulness and suggest improvements
    - [ ] Pattern Effectiveness Tracking: Track which patterns lead to successful refactorings
- [ ] **Extensibility**
    - [ ] Pattern Plugin System: Allow adding new/custom patterns via config or plugin

**Suggested Implementation Steps:**
1. Refactor `refactoring_patterns.py` to add ranking, metadata, and prompt generation
2. Update Pattern Selection UI with search/filter, modal, impact preview, and ranking
3. Integrate Pattern-to-Prompt logic in the LLM refactoring step
4. Add Feedback UI (optional)
5. Document extensibility in README or config example

**This file is the single source of truth for the professional refactoring workflow plan. All improvements and discussions should reference and update this document as the project evolves.**
